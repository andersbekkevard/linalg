# TODO List

## Eigenvalues

- Eigenvalues
- Eigenvectors
- Diagonalization
- M^n for large n

## Vector spaces

Methods to find these spaces for matricies:

- Null space (kernel)
- Column space (image)
- Row space
- Orthogonal complement

## Equation solvers

- Solver of systems of linear equations with:
  - 1 solution
  - 0 solutions
  - infinite solutions

## Linear regression

- Implement regression on datasets (least squares)

## Complex numbers

- Make all operations compatible with complex numbers

## Miscellaneous

- Rotation-operations in 2D/3D space

## Utility methods

- Parsing from string or file (CSV)
- Exporting to file
